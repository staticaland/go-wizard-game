This is a simple 2D game implemented in Golang using the Ebiten library. The game consists of a circle and bullets. The circle can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right, controlled by the arrow keys. The bullets are fired from the circle.

To run the game, you need to have Golang installed on your machine. Once you have Golang installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the directory containing the game files. You can then run the game using the following command:

```sh
make
